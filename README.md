# Battleship

## A quick guide

- The main goal of this project was to implement a basic battleship game, where the players can play against each other, against a computer or they can watch the computers playing against each other.
- In the main menu you can choose to play a new game, display the highscores or exit the game.
- The board is customizable and the users can choose the difficulty of the game as well.
- First the users can place their ships on the board by giving a starting position (for example A1) and then a direction ('h' for horizontal and 'v' vertical). The horizontal will place a three square long ship like A1-A2-A3. The vertical will place a two square long ship like A1-B1.
- After the placement phase, the shooting phase begins where players take turns and they can see the result of their turn on their table.
- The game ends when one of the players has succesfully sank every ship of the other player.
